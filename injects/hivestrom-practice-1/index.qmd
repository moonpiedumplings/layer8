Here is my score. I did worse than I thought I would have, and I am disappointed. 

There are a few key mistakes:

I did not read the injects/tasks before browsing around, and getting to work. This caused me to delete a file necessary to answering some of the questions, and I did not have time to restore from a backup. 

I should have made snapshots, so I did not have to do a full restore, or recreate the virtual machine.


I should be more familier with pam and password policies. I did some experimentation, but I don't think I did things like password requirements properly, otherwise I think I would have gotten points for them.

I also should have set up some file searching methods. After discussing this with my peers, there was a lot of media files lying around, and although I did some searching, it wasn't the level of extensiveness necessary to actually find the memes files lying around, and getting points. Learning how to use `find`, or `locate` to find media files would be nice, although I could also install a specific tool, but I think it's unlikely that Ubuntu 16 has access to the latest and greatest file indexing/searching software.
