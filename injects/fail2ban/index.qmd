Fail2ban is a service that blocks bots and other malicious machines based on their activity and ip addresses. 

I've decided to write an ansible playbook that will automate installation of fail2ban. 

```{.yml}
---
- name: Install Fail2ban and enable the service
  hosts: your_target_host
  become: yes  # You may need to escalate privileges, so become root/sudo

  tasks:
    - name: Install fail2ban
      ansible.builtin.package:
        name: fail2ban
        state: present

    - name: Enable Fail2ban service
      systemd:
        name: fail2ban
        enabled: yes
        state: started
```


It's stored in the same directory as this document, so just clone this repo and cd here. 

```{.default}
ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml --ask-become-pass
```

However, the manjaro machine, since it is archlinux based, does not support the same method of installing packages. 

To install fail2ban on the manjaro machine, I simply did:

`sudo pacman -Syu fail2ban`

`sudo systemctl enable --now fail2ban`
